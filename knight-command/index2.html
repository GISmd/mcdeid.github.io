            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><b><i>Knight Command</i></b> is a carpet-top game my boys and I invented
            (circa 2017) using Playmobile knights and little wooden planks. We had
            been building a castle with walls and other various buildings with the
            planks when I had an idea! What if we made up rules for how our knights
            fought?! We made up the rules as we went, but we liked the game so much
            that we decided to write down the rules.</p>
            <p>These "rules" are not rules at all! They are guidelines!!! (that's
                why this webpage is titled the "Knight Command <i>Guidebook</i>",
                silly!)so you should, in the spirit of how the game was created,
                make the rules work for you! If the game is taking too long to finish
                and you have to leave in time to make it to a family gathering, then 
                change the rules!</p>

                <p>The only <i>true</i> rule is that everyone has to agree with the new
                rules before they are instated. Be fair and kind! </p>

            <h2>Materials</h2>
            <p>We played the game with Playmobile knights (to fight with!) and KEVA
            Structures planks (to determine movement distance!), but who's to say
            that you can't use any other kind of figurines!</p>
            <h2>Movement</h2>
            <h3>Footsoldiers</h3>
            <p>Soldiers walking with their two feet on the ground may move</p>
